        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon finely ground pink salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme or rosemary on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut herbs and garlic into each other and the butter, cutting and mixing as you go. Add pink salt, black pepper, and paprika, and mix until well blended.</li>
        <li>Pat cod filets dry. In a 12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, place each filet on top of 2 lemon slices. Evenly divide herb butter mixture among the filets; use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb butter over filets. Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon slices.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cod flakes easily with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. See note.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
